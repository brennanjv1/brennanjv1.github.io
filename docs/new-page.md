1. **The Hub** - The home for documented standards and best practice at Version 1.  
2. **Technical Delivery Assurance** - An oversight element that ensures standards published on the TechX Hub are being followed correctly by our delivery teams.
3. **Communities of Practice** - Technical groups within Version 1 for people who share a passion for key technology areas. These provide an outlet to share and learn how to work better with these technologies through regular interactions.

## How to get in touch
Feel free to drop a note on the TechX Hub, to share ideas or for any assistance, or otherwise feel free to contact any of the Team Members. If you'd like to **volunteer** and get involved with building out any of the Areas listed here on TechX Hub then let us know. We'd love to hear from you!
